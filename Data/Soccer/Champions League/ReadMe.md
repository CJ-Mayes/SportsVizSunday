|Champions League|N/A|N/A| Tracking data for selected highlights from the Champion's League Final 8 Tournament that took place in Lisbon in 2020. <br/> The data was collected mainly to make the animations posted on twitter account @lastrowview, and it lacks the accuracy needed for research. Most notably, not all players are included in every play (although every player near the ball at any time is). Main file is CL2020_final8_tracking.csv (column descriptions available in the Data dictionary). |
